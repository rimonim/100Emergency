# תכלית מוקד 100 להציל חיים
In this repository, I will write R code (and prose) to analyze publicly available data related the Israeli 1-0-0 emergency police hotline, saving lives, and the relationship of the Jewish observant population to both of the above. 

I have two goals:
1. Practice data analysis skills (web scraping, data wrangling, graphical analysis, etc.)
2. Produce useful information about the workings of the 1-0-0 system and the extent to which it can be considered a life-saving system writ large. This line of research, though not clearly defined at outset, is important both for clearer public understanding of the benefits/pitfalls of the system and for the development of a comprehensive framework within halakha for dealing with the system and those who work within it.
